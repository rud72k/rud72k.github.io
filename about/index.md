<!-- My name is Rudi Adha Prihandoko. I am a lecturer at Universitas Gadjah Mada (Indonesia), Department of Mathematics. Before joining Universitas Gadjah Mada, I was doing bachelor and master both in Department of Mathematics, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Indonesia.

I was studying about p-adic number and it's representation for my bachelor thesis, and codes on algebraic curves for my master thesis. In my master studies, I was also a member of graduated research on elliptic curve cryptography, join research of Department of Electrical Engineering and Department of Mathematics, Institut Teknologi Bandung. Before my master studies I was also doing some simulation on two phase liquid injection on reservoir (project based research) on the laboratory of Near Surface of Department of Geophysics, Institut Teknologi Bandung. In my undergraduate studies and even before that, I was more into competition rather than research, participating in both domestic and international mathematical competition and the highest achievement was 3rd Prize in International Mathematical Competition, IMC (undergraduate) and Honourable Mention in International Mathematical Olympiad, IMO (high school).

While my research interest is widespread, I've been assigned in the Laboratory of Computational Mathematics, here in Universitas Gadjah Mada. So I hope to continue my study in the area of computational mathematics. Moreover, in the past decade, large-scale computing has become a prevalent means of discovery and of 'getting things done' in almost all areas of research and technology, and I eager to learn more about it.
