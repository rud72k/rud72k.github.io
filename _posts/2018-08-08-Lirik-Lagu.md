I were listening some Japanese songs this afternoon. Curious, I searched the lyrics as well as its translation. Here two songs I listened.


1. [Ashita Hareru Kana](#Ashita-Hareru-Kana)
2. [Goodbye Days](#goodbye-days)


Btw, I watched on YouTube at this link [Keisuke Kuwata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_UJ3HgpzNI) and  [Yui](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSD0ct3RVQA).


Credit goes to the original singer and creator.


Ashita Hareru Kana
------------------

Kuwata Keisuke - Ashita hareru kana

Atsui namida ya koi no sakebi mo
Kagayakeru hi wa doko e kieta no?
Asu mo atenaki michi wo samayou nara
Kore ijou moto ni wa modorenai

Mimi wo sumaseba kokoro no koe wa
Boku ni nani wo katarikakeru darou?
Ima wa yogoreta machi no katasumi ni ite
Ano koro no sora wo omou tabi ni

Kami yori tamaeshi kodoku ya toraburu
Nakitai toki wa naki na yo
Kore ga sadame deshou ka?
Akirameyou ka?
Kisetsu wa meguru mahou no you ni

Oh, baby. No, maybe.
"Ai" nakushite "jou" mo nai?
Nageku you na furi
Yo no naka no sei ni suru dake

Oh, baby. You're maybe.
"Ai" nakushite "raku" wa nai
Shiawase no Feeling
Dakishimete One more time.

Arishi hi no onore wo aisuru tame ni
Omoide wa utsukushiku aru no sa
Tooi kako yori mada minu jinsei wa
Yume hitotsu kanaeru tame ni aru

Kiseki no doa wo akeru no wa dare?
Hohoemi yo Mou ichido dake
Kimi wa kizuku deshou ka?
Sono kagi wa mou
Kimi no te no hira no ue ni

Why baby? Oh, tell me.
"Ai" nakushite "zou" mo nai?
Mite minai you na furi
Sono mi wo mamoru tame?

Oh, baby. You're maybe.
Mou sukoshi no shoubu ja nai!!
Kujikesou na Feeling
Norikoete One more chance.

I talk to myself...

Oh, baby. No, maybe.
"Ai" nakushite "jou" mo nai?
Nageku you na furi
Nokoru no wa koukai dake!!

Oh, baby. Smile baby.
Sono inochi wa towa ja nai
Daremo ga hitorihitori mune no naka de
Sotto sasayaite iru yo

"Ashita hareru kana..."

Haruka sora no shita

Ashita Hareru Kana (English Translation)
------------------------------

Where did the burning tears, the outcry of love,
the sparkling days vanish off to?
If we keep wandering down this aimless path
we'll never go back to the way things used to be

If you listen carefully, what would
my heart tell me?
Every time I imagine the sky as it was then
In the depths of this filthy town

The gifts of god... loneliness and troubles
Just cry when you feel like it
Is this destiny?
Should we give up?
The seasons are like a magical cycle

Oh, baby... No maybe.
Losing "love" and without "emotion"
Pretending to lament
and just blaming it all on the world

Oh, baby... You're maybe.
Losing "love" and without "comfort"
The feeling of happiness
Wrap me in your arms one more time

The memories remain vividly
in order to love your past self
Your unknown future, looking from the deep past
is for the sole fulfillment of your dream

Who opens the door to miracles?
Smile, just one more time
Will you notice?
That key
is already in the palm of your hand

Why, baby? Oh, tell me.
Losing "love" and without "emotion"
Pretending not to give it a chance
Is it to protect yourself?

Oh, baby. You're maybe.
The battle's almost won!!
Feeling like defeat
Overcome... One more chance.

I talk to myself...
Oh, baby. No, maybe.
Losing "love" and without "emotion"?
Pretending to lament
The only thing left is regret

Oh, baby. Smile baby.
That life of yours isn't for eternity
Everyone whispers softly to themselves
deep inside their hearts

"Will the sun come out tomorrow...?"

Underneath the distant skyï»¿


Goodbye Days
-----------------------------------

Dakara ima ai ni yuku soki metanda
Pokketo no kono kyokou kimi ni kikasetai

Sotto Voryuumu wo agete tashikamete mita yo

Oh Good-bye days ima kawaru ki ga suru kino made ni so long
Kakkoyokunail yasashi sa ga soba ni aru kara
La la la la la with you

Katahou no earphone wo kimi ni watasu
Yukkuri to nagarekomu kono shunkan

Umaku aisete imasu ka? Tama ni mayou kedo

Oh Good-bye days ima kawari hajimeta mune no oku alright
Kakkoyokunai yasashi sa ga soba ni aru kara
La la la la la with you

Dekireba kanashii omoi nante shitakunai
Demo yatte kuru deshou?
Sono toki egao de Yeah hello! My friend nantesa
Ieta nara ii no ni...

Onaji uta wo kuchizusamu toki soba ni ite I wish
Kakkoyokunail yasashi sa ni aete yokatta yo

La la la la Good-bye days

Goodbye Days (English Translation)
---------------------------------------------

So I'm going to go see you right now,  I've made up my mind
The song in my pocket, I want you to listen to it

Quietly, I turned up the volume, to make sure that it was there

Oh good-bye days, right now I've got the feeling that things are going to change; so long to everything up until yesterday
An  kindness is at my side
~With you

I pass one ear phone over to you
And this moment slowly streams over to you

Can you really love me? Even though I sometimes lose my way

Oh good-bye days, right now things inside my heart have begun to change, alright
An clumsy tenderness is at my side
~With you

If possible, I'd like to not have sad feelings
But they'll come to me, won't they?
In those times, it would be good, if only I could say
"Yeah, hello! My friend", with a smile

When we both are humming the same song, I wish for you to be by my side
I'm glad that we were able to meet each other, with such an clumsy tenderness

... Good-bye days
