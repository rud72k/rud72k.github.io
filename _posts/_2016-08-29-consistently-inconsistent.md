Last time, I stopped to write because I cant compile this blog via [jekyll](jekyll.rb). It's been a while when I realized that I forgot the extension of the file, `.md` or `.markdown`. But it's okay since lots of things I did was inconsistent. Until one day I realized that I am not consistent. Or more precisely, I am the ones who consistently inconsistent. 

Here are few things : 

- blog and write
- photography and photoshop
- geometry and mathematics in general
- english course and conversation
- enterpreneurship
- sell and resell
- guitar and music
- code and languages
- coding and cryptography
- training and body excercises
- work and go to work

Today I found a magical word that (I hope) can wake me up from my laze state to active state. (Of course any old machine need to adjusted first), and that is : 

### I AM FULL FLEDGE FATHER ###

Thanks for reading. Wait for my next inconsistent move, lad.
