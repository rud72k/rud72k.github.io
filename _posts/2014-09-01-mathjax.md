Move On from [WordPress](wordpress) to [Jekyll](jekyll) is not an easy task for me. The most difficult part is finding suitable themes, as always.  But after all, I want to try Jekyll static site, so here I am. 
<!--more-->

Making my own design is not something I'm capable of. So instead design it myself, I'm just roaming around to find suitables themes on [Jekyll wiki][jekyll-wiki]. Maybe this theme not one hundred percent satisfies me, but most part are great, so I decided to pick this theme after did some change within the color.

One thing after another, redo my whole site, I'm back to the same old problem. I couldn't display equation as it is. But [MathJax][mathjax] save the day again. I did this again: put the script between the `<head> ... </head>` and blah.. [Kramdown][kramdown] do the rest. The full documentation can be found at [kramdown site][kramdown-site] and [Mathjax][mathjax]. 

Source of this site can be found in GitHub. If you like to use this theme, just [fork me on GitHub][fork-me] but do not use my posting. Tweaking and changing can be found in [info][].

The script:

```
   <script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
      MathJax.Hub.Config({
        extensions: ["tex2jax.js"],
        jax: ["input/TeX", "output/HTML-CSS"],
        tex2jax: {
          inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], ["\\(","\\)"] ],
          displayMath: [ ['$$','$$'], ["\\[","\\]"] ],
          processEscapes: true
        },
        "HTML-CSS": { availableFonts: ["TeX"] }
      });
   </script>
