For the greater good, I'll try to list convention of symbols of math I used here in my blog. Except mentioned otherwise 
in particular post, I will use this convention. 

| Notation      | what I mean  |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| $AB$          | line $AB$    |
| $| AB |$      | length of segmen $AB$        |
| $[ABCD]$      | area of polygon $ABCD$       | 
| $(x_n)$       |  sequence of $x_n$ up to $n$ |
| $\sup_{x} f(x) $ | supremum of all possible $x$ within context |
