## How to Contact Me

Find me in my office on working hours. Notify me two or three hours in advance. On off hours, I'll be available on home address. Feel free to say hi to me at home. Contact me at my number only if necessary, but an email would be great.


If you are having any problems, any questions or suggestions, feel free to [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%40prihandokorudi), or [email me](mailto:rudi@ugm.ac.id).
